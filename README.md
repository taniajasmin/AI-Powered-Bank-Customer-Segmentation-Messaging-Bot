# AI-Powered-Bank-Customer-Segmentation-Messaging-Bot

This project outlines an n8n workflow designed to automate targeted customer outreach for a bank. Bank employees can simply tell a "chatbot" (simulated via a text input) what message to send and to which customer segment (e.g., "Send customers aged 40 or 40+ a message suggesting a savings account"), and the system will automatically identify the relevant customers and initiate the communication.


## Problem Statement

Banks need to send specific messages to different customer segments (promotions, financial advice, product announcements). Manual filtering and messaging is:
- Time-consuming
- Prone to errors
- Difficult to scale
This solution automates the entire process through AI-powered interpretation of natural language commands.


## Example Use Cases
- Targeted product recommendations
- Financial advice based on customer profiles
- Special offer announcements to specific segments
- Customer retention campaigns
  
## How It Works

The workflow processes natural language requests through these steps:

1. **Trigger**: Receives command via webhook or manual input  
   Example: "Send customers aged 40+ a message suggesting a savings account"

2. **LLM Processing**: Uses Gemini 2.0 Flash to extract:
   - Target customer criteria (age, salary range, etc.)
   - Message template
   - Suggested product

3. **Customer Filtering**: Applies criteria to customer database

4. **Personalization**: Customizes messages for each customer

5. **Delivery**: Sends via preferred channel (email, SMS, etc.)

Key Components
1. LLM Integration (Conceptual Python Implementation)
python
# Sample LLM processing logic
prompt = f"""
Analyze this bank request and extract criteria and message:
Request: "{user_request}"
Output JSON with criteria, message_template, product_suggested

"""

# API call to Gemini 2.0 Flash
response = await context.httpRequest({
    method: 'POST',
    url: gemini_api_url,
    body: {
        contents: [{"role": "user", "parts": [{"text": prompt}]}
    }
})
2. Customer Data Structure
```json
[
    {
        "id": "cust001",
        "name": "Alice Smith",
        "age": 35,
        "salary": 50000,
        "email": "alice@example.com"
    },
    ...
]
```

3. Message Personalization

```text
"Dear {customer_name}, we have a special offer on {product}!"
```
